# Binance Front-end Test (by Vladimir Josan)

## Getting start

1. `yarn server` to start proxy server (avoid CORS problem)
2. `yarn start` to start React App
3. Enjoy it, there's everything works in project (except add to favourites :) )

## Dependencies

###### There's only [estafette](https://www.npmjs.com/package/estafette), which is mine. I used it to demonstrate how It deals with requests.

## My regrets

###### I used Create React App which is definitely not ok for production, but for quick start it's perfect. Also, I didn't add e2e tests, because I don't have experience with it, I use only unit-tests and integrate tests with enzyme and testing-library.
